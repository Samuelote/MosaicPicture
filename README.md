# MosaicPicture
This is an image manipulation project implemented in Python.

## Example
mosaic.py reads an image then replaces each 20x20 segment with a 20x20 image from the image_data folder. Below is a demonstration of the current capabilities of the program.
<br>
<br>

<img alt="original image" src="greek.jpg" width="80%">
Original image
<br>
<br>
<img alt="manipulated image" src="greek_L2.jpg" width="80%">
Manipulated image
<br>
<br>

This takes an image and replaces each 20x20 pixel square with a smaller image to emulate the mosaic effect shown here: https://www.picturemosaics.com/photomosaics/id/14
